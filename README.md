Small card-like dungeon rogue game inspired by Solo Leveling. Main character has 5 types of attributes, you can upgrade him as you want. Various monsters and bosses inside the dungeon gonna give you various loot.
You can equip it on your hero or delete/sell it.
Additionally there are several types of loot - damaging loot, saving loot and unique loot.
If your hero run out of HP, you lost, dungeon is closing and you cant restore your loot or upgraded hero.
Each time dungeon are different than others, various types of monsters/buffs/debuffs/loot and so on...

As well I hope somewhen to add ability to gather friends or more than one hero to go to the dungeon.

And the gameloop gonna be a turn-like: you choose to attack enemy or to defend yourself and then enemies gonna have same choice.
You win the fight only if  every other monster has 0 HP and you have at least 1 HP.

And the last feature is you gonna get QUESTS through your trip into dungeon as well as Sung Jin Woo, but think twice before accepting it, there wiil not be any chance to cancel it...
